title: Hi Human!
description: Welcome to your new Docxy application.
---

The `index.md` file will be your home page.

This is an example page that shows examples of various elements and how they will render in your Docxy application.

You can have links to [external websites](https://traction.one), as well as [internal pages](/some/invalid/page).

<button>You can add a normal button</button>
<button disabled>And even a disabled button</button>

You can have inline code like `echo $I_AM_COOL`.
```
And you can have code blocks with line numbers.
```
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Oh, and it has full support for syntax highlighting too!")
}
```

You can highlight <kbd>K</kbd> <kbd>E</kbd> <kbd>Y</kbd> or use just about any <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> element.

> "You can have block quotes to quote something totally unnecessary, just like this quote."

<note>
You can add a note as well, if you want.
</note>

<note type="tip">
Or, a tip to give your "pro" tips.
</note>

<note type="warn">
You can even show a warning, like I should've warned you about my bad jokes in the beginning.
</note>

<note type="error">
Or, maybe a real danger like climate change!
</note>

<note type="success">
And finally here's a success note for successfully completing the tour of the examples.
</note>

Now, I'll add a separator to mark the end of the examples.
